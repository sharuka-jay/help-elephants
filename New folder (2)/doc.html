                        The Sri Lankan elephant is a subspecies of the Asian elephant that is only found in Sri Lanka. Since 1987, the IUCN has classified the Sri Lankan elephant as endangered. The Sri Lankan elephant population is now restricted to the dry zone in the north, east, and southeast of Sri Lanka. The average herd size is between 12 and 20 individuals. The oldest female elephant leads it in the herd.
                        As a result of construction and forest clearing, Elephants are pushed into smaller areas. In the first half of the 20th century, the Sri Lankan elephant population near around 7000 to 8000, and according to the DWC records, the current Sri Lankan elephant population is around 5000. In fact, some experts believe Sri Lankan elephants will be extinct in the wild within the next few decades.

                      <p>
                        The leading cause of death for elephants is clashing with villagers and farmers. The loss and destruction of their habitat have caused them to migrate through village areas. Elephants are also dying due to the high demand for ivory.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Destruction of crops, destruction of houses and damage to human lives are common problems in Sri Lanka. Due to this situation, the people in those villages resort to shooting and trapping the stray elephants for their safety. This condition has become a major threat to the lives of wild elephants

                  Our solution is to use a gps collar for wild elephants.
                  It monitors the roaming of wild elephants and sends a message to the villagers when they reach the village.
                  when the message receive before the elephant arrives will enable the villagers to take action.
                  This will enable safety of wild elephants and also humans. </p>

<p>
  Elephants are a very valuable resource to our country and the world. But they harm the farmers and the elephants live alone and in herds. Even if we try to chase the elephant, it will be a very difficult task. If we use the TUSKER TRACKER tracking belt, 
  we can easily locate the elephants. Using this device can prevent harm to the villagers from elephants.
</p>
<p>
  Using this system has a number of benefits. The primary benefit is that elephants will be protected. By marking corridors, we can analyze behavior by monitoring their locations and discourage activities that lead to a reduction in elephant population. Importantly, elephants are not harmed by this belt. Because The weight of one elephant collar is just 0.3 to 0.4 percent of an adult elephant's bodyweight. 
  It varies depending on the circumference of the neck.

                        An Elephant must first be selected with the help of the Wildlife Board. The elephant should be then be anesthetized. Once the elephant is anesthetized, the TUSKER TRACKER tracking tape should be wrapped around the elephant's neck. This strap is fastened so as not to damage the elephant and it is very strong.

                        The system receives locations through the gps tracking module. A server computer may be used to save the statistics. Data will be saved in the database, and information gathered during analysis will be saved as well. In the event that data is unable to be transmitted, the tracker has some storage space to save the data before it is possible to transmit it. The information can be accessed at any time by anyone who has access to a computer.
